This document summarizes the history of Talipan National High School, located in the developing barangay of Talipan between Pagbilao and Lucena.

Initially a community reliant on rice and coconut farming, the growing population saw a need for a local high school. In 1973, through the efforts of then-Barangay Captain Rafael P. Glorioso and a community petition, the Talipan Barangay High School was established under Republic Act 6054. It started with 60 students managed by the elementary school principal, Mr. Reynaldo Ladlad, and one pioneering teacher, Mr. Rodrigo G. Porta, who handled nearly all subjects.

The school expanded over the years, adding more teachers and celebrating its first graduation in 1976. A significant development came with the implementation of RA 6655 under President Corazon C. Aquino, which nationalized the teaching positions and improved salaries. Despite challenges like classroom shortages, which once led to it being called an "iskwater" school, it continued to grow.

Now known as Talipan National High School, it stands on a 0.6-hectare lot donated by the Quezon Provincial Government. The school has received numerous infrastructure improvements, including buildings funded by foreign (ESF, JICA) and local sources, as well as computer units and a covered court from former Governor Raffy P. Nantes and a computer laboratory from Governor Jay-Jay Suarez.

Under a series of dedicated principals, the school has garnered significant accolades, including being named a Brigada Eskwela Hall of Famer (2017), a Gawad Kalasag recipient (2016), and recognized as a "Best Managed School." Key administrative achievements include securing the school's land title and improving the water supply system. Today, under the leadership of its current Principal IV, G. Marina R. Abueva, the school continues to advance and gain recognition in various fields.
