      <p class="section-text">
        The Department of Education was established through the Education Decree
        of 1863 as the Superior Commission of Primary Instruction under a
        Chairman. The Education agency underwent many reorganization efforts in
        the 20th century in order to better define its purpose vis a vis the
        changing administrations and charters. The present day Department of
        Education was eventually mandated through Republic Act 9155, otherwise
        known as the Governance of Basic Education act of 2001 which establishes
        the mandate of this agency.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Department of Education (DepEd) formulates, implements, and
        coordinates policies, plans, programs and projects in the areas of
        formal and non-formal basic education. It supervises all elementary and
        secondary education institutions, including alternative learning
        systems, both public and private; and provides for the establishment and
        maintenance of a complete, adequate, and integrated system of basic
        education relevant to the goals of national development.
