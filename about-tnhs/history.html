            This page summarizes the history of Talipan National High School,
            located in the developing barangay of Talipan between Pagbilao and
            Lucena. Initially a community reliant on rice and coconut farming,
            the growing population saw a need for a local high school. In
            1973, through the efforts of then-Barangay Captain Rafael P.
            Glorioso and a community petition, the Talipan Barangay High
            School was established under Republic Act 6054. It started with 60
            students managed by the elementary school principal, Mr. Reynaldo
            Ladlad, and one pioneering teacher, Mr. Rodrigo G. Porta, who
            handled nearly all subjects.

            The school expanded over the years, adding more teachers and
            celebrating its first graduation in 1976. A significant
            development came with the implementation of RA 6655 under
            President Corazon C. Aquino, which nationalized the teaching
            positions and improved salaries. Despite challenges like classroom
            shortages, which once led to it being called an "iskwater" school,
            it continued to grow.

            Now known as Talipan National High School, it stands on a
            0.6-hectare lot donated by the Quezon Provincial Government. The
            school has received numerous infrastructure improvements,
            including buildings funded by foreign (ESF, JICA) and local
            sources, as well as computer units and a covered court from former
            Governor Raffy P. Nantes and a computer laboratory from Governor
            Jay-Jay Suarez.

            Under a series of dedicated principals, the school has garnered
            significant accolades, including being named a Brigada Eskwela
            Hall of Famer (2017), a Gawad Kalasag recipient (2016), and
            recognized as a "Best Managed School." Key administrative
            achievements include securing the school's land title and
            improving the water supply system. Today, under the leadership of
            its current Principal IV, G. Marina R. Abueva, the school
            continues to advance and gain recognition in various fields.
